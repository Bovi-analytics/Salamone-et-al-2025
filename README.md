## Interpretive summary

The transition period in dairy cows, spanning six weeks around calving, is a critical phase when cows are more susceptible to infectious and metabolic diseases, impacting both health and productivity. Using an AI model, predicted milk yields were calculated, and actual milk yields were subtracted to obtain milk yield residuals. From our results, the behavioral differences between cows with varying milk residuals are in line with behavioral pattern of transition fail in dairy cows. This  strengthen the potential application of this residuals as a metabolic indicator, where they might support  the development of new automated health monitoring tools.
